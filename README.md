ARGOSVision-Dev
===============

ARGOS implementation of vision-based landing pad marker recognition for automatic landing. This is the development version to be used for lab testing.

Application description
-----------------------

The ARGOS Vision Development software is a computer vision application aimed to assess vision-based automatic landing for the ARGOS system.

Project is tagged as 'Development' as it is not aimed to be used onboard, but to run on a desktop computer for testing purposes. The application implements all required logging mechanisms to conduct tests both on live webcam feeds and on recorded video sequences, which will be used to characterize and eventually improve the processing, detection and tracking of fiducial markers used for automatic landing, as well as improving the marker structure to optimize detection in real outdoor conditions. 

Source code is prepared for compiling under Windows using Visual Studio 2010 and OpenCV. No other external libraries are required.
